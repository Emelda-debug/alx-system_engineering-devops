command line for the win task

After finishing the challenges on the browswer, I took screenshots and saved them on a folder on my local machine. The next step was to transfer using SFTP. The steps are outlined below:

Steps to transfer using STFP
1. cd into directory on mac terminal  with screenshots
2. Go to snadbox on the intranet and select UBUNTU 20.04
3. Wake it if asleep then copy the sftp.
4. Return to terminal and paste the code
5. It will prompt you to respond with a YES or NO
6. Type yes and it will prompt you to enter the password
7. Go back to sandox and click on the password written where the sftp was copied.
8. After pasting the password, it will write sftp.
9. Type lpwd, to show the working directory
9. You can also type lls to see what is in the folder, i.e. in this case the screenshots
10. Use the command put to move the screenshots to sandbox
11. To do this type put then screenshot name e.g. "put screenshot1"
12. It will show uploading image and 100% when it is done
13. After they are all uploaded, go to sandbox and open webterm.
14. ls, to see if the pictures were successful then move them to the directory you are tasked to create.
15. The directory is commandlineforthewin.
16. To check if you were successful, when you ls in the command_line_for_the_win directory, you should have 4 files, screenshots and a descriptive README.md
DONE
