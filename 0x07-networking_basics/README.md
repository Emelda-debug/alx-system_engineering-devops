0x07-networking_basics
this task was to introduce networking. 
It looked at the OSI model 
the layers include 
Physical layer- which is used for data transfer through electrical impulses and optical signals e.g. ethernet,
Data link layer- is used for error detection using MAC adresses and also ensures the address is correct
Network  layer-  uses IP adress to indentify devices in the networks
Transport layer- uses tranmission controls such as TCP and UDP to ensure that data is sent correctly. e.g TCP - prioritises 
accuracy of data and destination but UDP prioritises speed 
Session Layer- is used for maintaining terminating and establishing communication sessions.
It chooses things such as session IDs and sequence numbers for aid.
Presentation Layer- s important to make sure that the data is represented in the correct format which uses things
like encryption translation data compression e.g. jpeg, 
Application Layer- This is what we use humans interact with for example, web browser email etc e.g. https, ftp
