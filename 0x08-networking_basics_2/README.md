0x08. Networking basics
I managedto figure out the difference between 127.0.0.1 and 0.0.0.0
0.0.0.0 is a non-routable address that describes an invalid or unknown target
These are the other uses of 0.0.0.0
can theoretically be set as a device's subnet mask rather than its IP address
depending on usage  firewall or router software might use 0.0.0.0 to indicate that
every IP address should be blocked (or allowed)
The name localhost normally resolves to the IPv4 loopback address 127.0.0.1, and to the IPv6 loopback address ::1.
